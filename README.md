## ❓ Q / A

**Q: How do I add support for custom Yo-kai?**  
A: Simply copy-paste the custom Yo-kai data into the `yokai.js` file located in the `data` folder of the editor. This will let the editor recognize and display your custom entries instead of leaving it blank.

**Q: Can this editor change the rank of a Yo-kai?**  
A: No. This is a save editor, not a game editor or modder. For modding the game, please use other tools such as [Albatross](https://github.com/Tiniifan/Albatross).

**Q: Does the editor support all versions of Yo-kai Watch 2?**  
A: This editor is tested on EUR and USA v2.0, but will work for all 2.0 versions, and may work for 1.0 and JP versions, albeit with limited support.

**Q: Does the editor support Yo-kai Watch 1 or other games?**  
A: Currently, the editor is only designed for Yo-kai Watch 2 saves. Support for other versions may be added in the future.

**Q: Is it safe to edit my save with this editor?**  
A: While the editor is tested and reliable, always **backup your save files** before making changes. Corruption can occur if invalid data is introduced.

**Q: How do I report bugs or request features?**  
A: Open an issue on the project’s GitHub repository or contact the maintainers via the provided communication channels.
