**Note**: this should be quite obvious, but this is only for items, for most features consult [general.md](https://github.com/n123git/YWSaveEditor/blob/main/docs/general.md).

Items can be split into:
* Consumables (Everything that isn't the below)
* Equipment (Equipment.... obvious enough)
* Critters (Insects and Fish)
* Souls (Souls... pretty obvious)
* Key Items (Note: Internally Key Items that display an image are considered a different category, but this dosen't apply to save editing)

These categories define where in the save files they are placed:

Consumables: `0x04`<br/>
Equipment: `0x05`<br/>
Key Items: `0x06`<br/>
Souls: `0x13`
