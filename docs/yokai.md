This *should* be obvious, but this is only for Yo-kai editing, for most other tasks consult [general.md](https://github.com/n123git/YWSaveEditor/blob/main/docs/general.md) or [head.md](https://github.com/n123git/YWSaveEditor/blob/main/docs/head.md).


This documentation won't help you if you don't understand basic hex constructs and endianness.

---

**Note**: assume the data is little-endian unless stated otherwise and the "Offsets" are in bytes, NOT bits.
Yo-kai begin at the `SectionID` `0x07` (7). Check `general.md` for more. 
  - This can semi-reliably be approximated to the absolute offset `0x5108` 
   
Each Yo-kai entry is has a length of `0x5C` (92) bytes.

| Offset | Type    | Name             | Description           | 
|--------|---------|------------------|-----------------------|
| 0x00   | uint16  | num1             | #0's complete purpose is unknown, but it is known to be used for sorting/reference. |
| 0x02   | uint16  | num2             | #1's complete purpose is unknown, but it is known to be used for sorting/reference. |
| 0x04   | uint32  | YokaiID          | The Yo-kai's ID, note that Type Rares have different IDs, and so do boss vs befriendable Yo-kai. Check my `data` folder for a list of all Yo-kai ID's. 0 = Empty slot.|
| 0x08   | uint24  | Nickname         | The Yo-kai's Nickname in UTF-8. `0x0` = No Nickname. Unused characters render as a filled black box.|
| 0x20   | uint20  | Misc             | The 11th byte refers to the atack level, the 15th refer's to the technique level, and the 18th refers to the soultimate level i.e. `0A`= level 10.|
| 0x34   | uint32  | XP               | The Current XP *towards* the next level, NOT the total XP. |
| 0x38   | int16   | HP Remaining     | The Current amount of HP Remaining. |
| 0x3A   | int16   | Soul Remaining   | The Current amount of Soul Remaining. |
| 0x3C   | uint32  | OwnerID          | The Owner of the Yo-kai, used for trading. |
| 0x40   | uint8   | IV_HP            | IV for HP. | 
| 0x41   | uint8   | IV_Str           | IV for STR (Strength).| 
| 0x42   | uint8   | IV_Spr           | IV for SPR (Spirit). | 
| 0x43   | uint8   | IV_Def           | IV for DEF (Defense).| 
| 0x44   | uint8   | IV_Spd           | IV for SPD (Speed).|
| 0x45   | uint8   | EV_HP            | EV for HP. | 
| 0x46   | uint8   | EV_Str           | EV for STR (Strength).| 
| 0x47   | uint8   | EV_Spr           | EV for SPR (Spirit). | 
| 0x48   | uint8   | EV_Def           | EV for DEF (Defense).| 
| 0x49   | uint8   | EV_Spd           | EV for SPD (Speed).|
| 0x4A   | uint8   | unknown          | Unknown. |
| 0x4B   | int8    | SC_Str           | SC buff/nerf for STR (Strength). |
| 0x4C   | int8    | SC_Spr           | SC buff/nerf for SPR (Spirit). |
| 0x4D   | int8    | SC_Def           | SC buff/nerf for DEF (Defense). |
| 0x4E   | int8    | SC_Spd           | SC buff/nerf for SPD (Speed).|
| 0x4F   | uint8   | Level            | The Yo-kai's level usually 0-99 (`0x0`-`0x63`). Levels higher than `0x63` will automatically be changed to 99 (`0x63`) by the game. |
| 0x50   | uint32  | Win Pose Data    | The first byte is the selected pose, while the rest forms a bitmask of unlocked poses. Refer to my `data` folder for pose lookup code, as it is too complicated to explain here. |
| 0x54   | uint8   | Loaf Data        | Loafing behavior (high 4 bits) and Attitude (low 4 bits). Check the `data` dir for more information regarding decoding. |

- The next 7 bytes include several pieces of data, such as the current Soultimate for Jibanyan and Alliance (BS/FS). The first (high) nibble of the 1st out of the 7 bytes refer to Bony/Fleshy `1` = Fleshy/Wicked, `0` = Bony. This stays the same for Type Rare and Version Exclusive Yo-kai, but cannot be used for Jibanyan (and potentially other Auto-befriend Yo-kai). Very simple.
